        “My dream for the future is to create my very own video game. Something that brings people 
        together, tells a story worth remembering, and allows players to fully immerse themselves in 
        a world I've imagined and built from the ground up. I envision a game that not only entertains 
        but resonates emotionally, with meaningful characters, new creatures, and interesting 
        environments. In addition to game development, I hope to explore the world of animation and 
        voice acting. Animation excites me because it’s a powerful way to breathe life into the 
        worlds that I’ve envisioned since I was a child. I’ve always wanted to give shape and motion 
        to what once only lived only in my mind. Voice acting on the other hand, allows for the 
        expression of emotion and personality in a unique, intimate way, it's the heart and soul 
        behind the characters that players grow attached to. Ultimately, my goal is to be a 
        storyteller across multiple mediums, blending technology and art to create experiences that 
        leave a lasting impact. Whether through pixels, voices, or moving frames, I want to share 
        stories that inspire others the way I've been inspired by games and animation throughout my 
        life.”
